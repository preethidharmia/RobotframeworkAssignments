1. Write a Python function that removes duplicate elements from a list while preserving the original order.
(Example: [4, 1, 4, 2, 1] - [4, 1, 2])
2. Given a dictionary with employee names and salaries, write a program to find the employee with the second-highest salary.
Avoid using built-in sorted() directly on the full dictionary.
3. Create a generator function that yields even numbers up to a given limit. Show how to iterate over it and print results.
4. Write a program that counts how many times each word occurs in a paragraph of text. Ignore punctuation and treat words in a case-insensitive way.
5. Given a list of integers, separate them into two lists: one containing even numbers and the other containing odd numbers.
6. Write a function that accepts any number of positional arguments and returns their average.
Test the function with sample inputs.
7. Create a class BankAccount with methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and check balance.
Add validation for insufficient balance.
8. Write a Python program to read a CSV file and display only the rows where a specific column meets a given condition.
9. Write a function that takes a string and returns True if it's a palindrome after removing spaces and
punctuation.
10. Given two lists, write a program to find elements that exist in both lists (intersection) without
using set operations.
11. Write a program to flatten a nested list (eg. [1, [2, [3, 4]], 5] - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). Use recursion.
12. Create a decorator that logs the execution time of any function it wraps.
Demonstrate with a sample slow function.
13. Write a program to merge two dictionaries. If the same key exists, sum the values.
Example: ('a': 10) + ('a': 20) ('a': 30)
14. Given a list of tuples representing student names and scores, sort them by score in descending
order.
15. Write a function to find the longest word in a list of strings.
16. Create a program that simulates rolling two dice and prints the sum for each roll. Allow the user to choose number of rolls.
17. Write code to remove all occurrences of a specific value from a list without using list
comprehensions.
18. From a string containing mixed characters, extract only the digits and return them as an integer.
Example: "a1b23c9" 1239
19. Implement a small module with two functions: one for calculating factorial (using loops), and one using recursion.
Compare results for a sample number.
20. Write a Python script to check if two given strings are anagrams of each other.
Ignore spaces and letter case.
