1. Identify Outliers Using Z-Score,

Write a program to calculate the z-score for a numeric column and filter all rows where |z| > 3 (outliers).

2. Rank Employees Based on Performance

Given a DataFrame of employees with performance scores, use rank() to assign ranks in descending order and handle ties properly.

3. Create a MultiIndex DataFrame, Create a MultiIndex DataFrame using two categorical columns (eg., Region and Product) and apply an aggregation such as total sales.

4. Sort a DataFrame by Multiple Columns Sort a DataFrame first by "department", then by "salary" in decreasing order.

5. Calculate Rolling Window Statistics

Given time-series stock prices, compute a 7-day rolling mean and 14-day rolling standard deviation.

6. Convert Wide Format Data to Long Format Using melt(), convert a DataFrame of student marks across subjects into a long-form structure with columns: student, subject, marks.

7. Replace Specific Values in a DataFrame Replace all occurrences of "Not Available" or "N/A" in a dataset with np.nan.

8. Filter Rows Based on Text Pattern Using str.contains(), filter all rows where a column (e.g., "comments") contains the keyword "refund".

9. Create a New Column Based on Conditions Use np.where() or apply() to classify rows as: "High Salary" if salary > 75,000 "Medium Salary" if salary between 40,000-75,000 "Low Salary" otherwise

10. Detect Duplicate Records Based on Selected Columns
